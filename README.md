# C# DOD Playground

Inspiration for this project came from  and serves as an experiment to better understand how a Data-Oriented Design might be approached in C#. The basic version of this project is a bunch of dots flying about on the screen and having their speed altered by the bubbles they pass through.

## Getting Started

Project setup should be relatively simple. Once the repository had been cloned simply restore all NuGet packages and issue a full build twice. Due to a slight oddity in how content is built within MonoGame there were some issues in having the common content copy correctly to the output directory.

## Running

Each of the examples can be found under the "01 - Game" solution folder. There are 3 different samples:

* More traditional OOP approach. Dots and Bubbles both inherit from a base GameObject class.
* Naive Composition approach. Game logic has been moved into components contained within lists on a GameObject.
* Component driven approach where logic lives in two systems with an SoA (Structure of Arrays) driving "GameObject" like behaviour.

* Richard Fabian's [Data-Oriented Design](http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/site.php) provided a number of insights into the topic.
